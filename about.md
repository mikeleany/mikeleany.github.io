title: About Mike Leany

I am **Mike Leany** ([/leɪni/][IPA] [LAY-nee][respelling]), am a software engineer from [Utah] in the United States. I studied computer science at [Snow College] and [Utah State University].

I worked as a developer at [RR Donnelley] for 12 years (from 2009 through 2021) before leaving to pursue other interests. I have been on a [Sabbatical] of sorts through the first half of 2022, during which time, my first granddaughter was born.

While I won't go into detail about my family, to protect their privacy, my family consists of me, my wife, an adult son, two young daughters and now a granddaughter. 

I am also a member of [The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]. We are sometimes referred to as Mormons because, in addition to the [Bible], we also believe in another book of scripture called the [Book of Mormon] which tells of "God's dealing with ancient inhabitants of the Americas"[^1] and is "[Another Testament of Jesus Christ]."[^2]

At 19 years old I served a two-year mission for the Church in the Chilean cities of [Viña del Mar], [Valparaíso], [Coquimbo], [La Serena], [Quillota], El Melón and [Nogales]. I have also served as a volunteer worker at one of the Church's temples.
