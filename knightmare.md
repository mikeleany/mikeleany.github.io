title: Knightmare Chess Engine
author: Mike Leany

Knightmare was the name I gave to my first experimental prototypes in chess programming. Knightmare was succeeded by [Zilch], [Vapor] and [Tinman].

Knightmare ran on Windows and had minimal support for the WinBoard protocol. I previously released a version called Knightmare BP, though I later removed it from my site and no longer have a copy of it myself.
