title: Zilch Chess Engine
author: Mike Leany

Zilch was a private computer chess engine and the predecessor to [Vapor] and [Tinman]. It was my first stable chess engine. It was preceded by some prototypes I called [Knightmare], but they were only experimental and very unstable.

Zilch was written from scratch and not based on Knightmare in any significant way. While I intended to release it eventually, it turned out to be [vaporware] -- which inspired the name of its successor, the [Vapor] chess engine. Zilch ran on Linux and used the xboard protocol.
